/**
 * Hold Invoice (Escrow) Flow
 *
 * Demonstrates the hold invoice pattern for conditional/escrow payments:
 * 1. Receiver creates invoice with payment_hash (no preimage upfront)
 * 2. Payer sends payment — funds are held in-flight
 * 3. Receiver verifies conditions are met
 * 4. Receiver settles invoice by revealing preimage — funds released
 *
 * This enables trustless escrow: the receiver only gets paid when they
 * prove they've fulfilled their obligations by revealing the preimage.
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 * - Two connected Fiber nodes with a funded channel between them
 *
 * Run: npx tsx examples/hold-invoice.ts
