# fiber-pay

AI-friendly toolchain for CKB Lightning on Fiber Network.

Fiber target: `v0.6.1`

## Positioning

`fiber-pay` is built to make Fiber programmable for both humans and AI agents:

- `@fiber-pay/sdk`: typed building blocks for Fiber RPC, verification, and policy logic
- `@fiber-pay/cli`: stable operator + automation interface with machine-readable output
- `@fiber-pay/runtime`: orchestration runtime for jobs, monitoring, retries, and proxy-facing automation loops
- `@fiber-pay/node`: easy handling for the local `fnn` binary lifecycle

## Why this repo is AI-friendly

- Canonical skill guide for agents: `skills/fiber-pay/SKILL.md`
- Predictable grouped commands (`node/channel/invoice/payment/job/peer/binary/config/graph/runtime`)
- Uniform `--json` envelopes for reliable parsing and tool chaining
- NDJSON stream events for `watch --json` commands
- Explicit defaults for startup, ports, binary path, and key password behavior
